- make sure to explain why what I did is better than other approaches and why?! What benefits does it offer?
- e.g. Compared to other systems, bla bla bla

--------------------------------------------------------

[check] - clearly state out the problem and what I've been doing, even if the listener does not understand: I have tried to address this problem... what was the goal of the thesis!

[check] - Who I'm designing for?! State this out early!

- given an overview of the architecture and then pick one topic to focus on!

Introduction to the subject of the thesis; try to break down/explain the title and purpose of the thesis
    -- Hi, my name is Karoly Szanto and in the followings I will walk you through the work I've done as part
       of my masters' thesis where I have researched and designed An Environment Simulator for Mobile
       Context-Aware System Design!

The Problem
    -- Designing and developing mobile context-aware systems in a real-life set-up represents a tedious,
       costly and time consuming process. In addition, most systems require testing and experimentation
       in their target location for valid and beneficial results to be produced; however it is difficult
       and costly to set up a certain location to support the designed system. Moreover, incorporating
       physical objects into the system design, adds up to the aforementioned challenges.

Short introduction to EgoSim and what it does

Describe the BIG problem -- what it is and what is the answer for it (simulator)
Describe the SMALL problem -- the actual problem that I have solved in this thesis
    -- egocentric interaction paradigm
    -- the SSM as part of it
    -- why is this such a big deal for me? why did I choose to treat this problem


    
A motivational example of how this my work solve the problem!
    -- I'm thinking to present the SECURE_OUTLET scenario
Short description of my solution
    -- gotta figure out how technical to get here ?!
    -- probably just stay at a really high level... somewhere at design level
    -- talk about most components: e.g. the agent, the scene, etc
Present the Evaluation Results
    -- what kind of evaluation I've done and why; I wanted to do a comparative evalution... (take this part
       from the thesis)
    -- number of participants and their profile
    -- what kind of questions did I ask
    -- a summary of the results
    -- present a few user answers as quotes ;) -- some good & some bad
