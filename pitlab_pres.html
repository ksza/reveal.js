<!--     In this thesis, we have designed and developed EgoSim, an opensource simulation environment for mobile context-aware system design. The framework is meant to be used by system designers to produce simulations of their target egocentric system. The resulting simulations are body-centric, meaning that the simulation user interacts with the simulation environment by controlling a virtual avatar. As the agent interacts with the environment, physical objects and devices in its surroundings are classified according to the SSM context model.This data is available through an API to be accessed by third party service and to be visualised in the ContextClient.

Help system designers produce simulations of their target egocentric systems.

        While designing mobile pervasive computing environments, software developers are bound to work with cutting edge hardware and software technologies and to adopt new communication models for HCI.
    </li>
    <li>
        Much of the effort has been devoted to address hardware and software challenges and with the explosion of devices in the form of mobile phones and tablets having a wide range of sensing capabilities, modelling of context-aware software became device-centric. This way, designers of mobile contextaware systems base their design mostly on device sensory data.
    </li>
    <li>
        In our everyday lives we encounter and interact with our surrounding environment through a wide range of mobile devices and physical objects. While the current device-centric modeling makes it easy to incorporate devices, incorporating physical objects into a contextaware system design, remains a challenge. When trying to integrate physical objects into the system design, the designer is bound to think in terms of existing technologies that can facilitate their integration; for example, making a system aware of a chair, a designer might think about attaching various sensors to it (pressure, motion, proximity, etc). While the device-centric modeling makes it natural to think about devices, when it comes to integrate physical objects, it limits the designer instead of offering a natural way to solve the problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        The egocentric-interaction paradigm addresses the struggle of conceptually incorporating the real world into the system design. It is a bodycentric modeling framework that incorporates physical objects, mediators (i.e. devices) and virtual objects on the basis of proximity and human perception. ”Egocentric” signals that it is the human body and mind of a specific human individual that acts as centre of reference to which all modeling is anchored in this interaction paradigm.

                        <p>Designing and developing mobile context-aware systems in a real-life set-up represents a tedious, costly and time consuming process. Moreover, incorporating physical objects into the system design, making further development and evaluation of the egocentric paradigm a challenge.</p>

<small>                            
    Evaluating the SSM was a tedious work and consisted in creating a real-life setup,
    with digitally enhanced physical objects (various sensors to track agent proximity
    and actions) while using a wide range of technologies to track the agent's current
    situation (body position, orientation, visual spectrum etc.). This is a costly and
    time consuming process making further development and evaluation of the egocentric
    paradigm a challenge.

    The goal of this project is to design and implement an open-source
    simulation framework that can help developers of mobile contextaware
    systems to explore design alternatives. The framework has to dynamically classify
    physical objects, virtual objects and mediators that are close to the human agent
    according to the situative space model (SSM), allowing the context-aware system
    developer to design system logic on the basis of this classification. The human
    agent is to be represented as an avatar that can move around and perform basic
    interaction with objects in the simulated environment.

    This scenario has been used as a ground for gathering requirements for our
    system!

    The hypothetical problem presented in this scenario is that families
    cannot make their homes secure enough for their children. To provide
    a solution for this problem, there’s a need for a system to constantly
    monitor the objects a child should keep away from and should not
    be interacting with. Based on this context information, we can further
    build various software service to secure the house from the child’s
    actions. One example of such service is the "Secure Outlets Service"
    (SOS). This service has to detect whenever a child is approaching an
    outlet with a small object, in which case it should shut down the electricity
    switch for outlets, preventing the child from the possibility of
    getting electrocuted.

    A good solution for this problem could be based on the egocentric
    interaction paradigm, as it can categorizes all the objects of interest
    around the human agent. Before implementing the system in a real
    world set-up, it is best to validate the design by simulating it.
