                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p>Designing and developing mobile context-aware systems in a real-life set-up represents a tedious, costly and time consuming process.</p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            - Evaluating the SSM was a tedious work and consisted in creating a real-life setup,
                              with digitally enhanced physical objects (various sensors to track agent proximity
                              and actions) while using a wide range of technologies to track the agent’s current
                              situation (body position, orientation, visual spectrum etc.). This is a costly and
                              time consuming process making further development and evaluation of the egocentric
                              paradigm a challenge.

                        <h3>The Goal</h3>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p>"Simulation enables researchers to evaluate scenarios and applications without the difficulties of dealing with hardware sensors and actuators."</p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            - The goal of this project is to design and implement an open-source
                              simulation framework that can help developers of mobile contextaware
                              systems to explore design alternatives. The framework has to dynamically classify
                              physical objects, virtual objects and mediators that are close to the human agent
                              according to the situative space model (SSM), allowing the context-aware system
                              developer to design system logic on the basis of this classification. The human
                              agent is to be represented as an avatar that can move around and perform basic
                              interaction with objects in the simulated environment.

                        <h3>Example Scenario: Secure Outlets</h3>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p><small>The hypothetical problem presented in this scenario is that families cannot make their homes
                           secure enough for their children. To providea solution for this problem, there’s a need for
                           a system to constantly monitor the objects a child should keep away from and should not be interacting with.</small></p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            This scenario has been used as a ground for gathering requirements for our
                            system!

                            The hypothetical problem presented in this scenario is that families
                            cannot make their homes secure enough for their children. To provide
                            a solution for this problem, there’s a need for a system to constantly
                            monitor the objects a child should keep away from and should not
                            be interacting with. Based on this context information, we can further
                            build various software service to secure the house from the child’s
                            actions. One example of such service is the "Secure Outlets Service"
                            (SOS). This service has to detect whenever a child is approaching an
                            outlet with a small object, in which case it should shut down the electricity
                            switch for outlets, preventing the child from the possibility of
                            getting electrocuted.

                            A good solution for this problem could be based on the egocentric
                            interaction paradigm, as it can categorizes all the objects of interest
                            around the human agent. Before implementing the system in a real
                            world set-up, it is best to validate the design by simulating it.
